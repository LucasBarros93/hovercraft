## Proposal

**The project consists of constructing an autonomous Hovercraft, capable of perceiving the world and making decisions about its movement.**

A Hovercraft is a vehicle designed to float and move on a cushion of compressed air created by fans that force air through a cushion beneath its underside. The craft hovers above the surface and moves with relative ease across various terrains, including water, ice, swamps, and even rough terrain. This is made possible through the combination of an air cushion and usually a forward-propelling engine.

## O Grupo
Our group has been subdivided into four fundamental areas: Mechanics, Electronics, Firmware, and Software. Each of these areas plays an essential role in the operation of our robot, contributing in distinct ways to ensure the success of our project.

1. **Mechanics:**
Responsible for performing the necessary calculations to create the physical skeleton of the robot, which involves the design and construction of the hull using AutoCAD. 

2. **Electronics:**
Design the electronic diagram, select and assemble the robot's electrical circuits and components, including calculations to ensure the correct electrical supply to the robot.

3. **Firmware:**
Develop the code that resides directly in electronic components, such as microcontrollers, and establish their communication with the other electronic components of the robot.

4. **Software:**
Process the information coming from the camera and develop decision-making algorithms responsible for controlling the robot's movement.

## The Challenge
The main task of this project is for the robot to glide across a surface at a minimal speed and autonomously, meaning without human interference in its control. This segment will be the corridor at CROB (USP Robotics Center), which has a fairly smooth surface for the hovercraft to navigate.

FOur group was granted permission to modify the environment as we wished, meaning adding objects that would guide the robot through the corridor.


## Our Robot 
Nos inspiramos no personagem "Relâmpago McQueen" do filme "Carros". Em homenagem ao filme, nosso robô foi batizado de Relâmpago Marquinhos.

Inserir imagens do Relâmpago Marquinhos lado a lado com o nosso Marquinhos pronto.
